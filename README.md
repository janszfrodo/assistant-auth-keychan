![Demo](https://example.com/-fragments.png)

## Features
- **Collect  Fragments**: Gather cache data from different server instances
- **Merge Data Streams**: Combine parallel data flows into unified structures
- **Balance Load**: Real-time alignment of server resource allocation
- **Sort Instances**: Organize servers by processing speed
- **Performance Statistics**: Track system efficiency across deployments

## Functionality
#### 1. Adding  Fragments
Users can discover new  fragments by scanning across server clusters. Each fragment contains unique data attributes and instance signatures.

#### 2. Releasing Cache
Users can clear outdated cache patterns by clicking the garbage collection button. A confirmation prompt ensures data is properly invalidated.

#### 3. Achieving Sync
Users can merge fragments by achieving data consistency. Synchronized state is visually represented with status indicators.

#### 4. Sorting Servers
Users can sort server instances by three criteria:
1. **Processing Speed**: Faster instances first
2. **Location**: Geographic server regions
3. **Load Capacity**: Available vs utilized resources

#### 5. System Metrics
The app provides real-time statistics about  utilization. It displays total fragments collected, sync percentage, and instance coverage. When optimal performance is achieved, system optimization is displayed.
